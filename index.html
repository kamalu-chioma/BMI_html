        <h2>Why BMI?</h2>
        <p>
            Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple yet effective tool used globally to assess an individual's body weight relative to their height. 
            It helps categorize weight into different health-related categories, such as <strong>Underweight</strong>, 
            <strong>Healthy Weight</strong>, <strong>Overweight</strong>, and <strong>Obesity</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            While BMI isn't a direct measure of body fat, it serves as a quick indicator of potential health risks like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, 
            and more. Tracking your BMI over time can also help monitor progress towards fitness and health goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Did you know? The concept of BMI was first introduced in the 1830s by Belgian mathematician Adolphe Quetelet. 
            Today, it's a widely recognized standard in medical and fitness fields for evaluating overall health.
